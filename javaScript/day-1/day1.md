JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language mainly used to make web pages **interactive**, **dynamic**, and **functional**.

JavaScript runs in browsers and on servers using **Node.js**.

## 🧾 What is ECMAScript?

**ECMAScript (ES)** is the **standard / specification** of the JavaScript language defined by **ECMA International (ECMA-262)**.
It describes:

* Syntax
* Rules
* Core features of the language

Versions are named like:

## 🔍 JavaScript vs ECMAScript
